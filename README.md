# pharaohcoin
Fyx gaming take home assignment React, Nodejs 

The objective:
The pharaoh of Egypt had ordered a new Pyramid to be built in the Capital, near the Nile
river. The Pyramid would consist only of stone blocks. The mining site where the blocks are
produced is 10 miles down the river. The only way to get to the mining site is by using boats on
the river. Only two boats can be in the river, regardless of the direction they travel. The distance
in time between the mining site and the Pyramid building location in the capital is 10 min. Each
boat can carry up to 6 blocks. It takes 1 min to load a single block on a boat and it takes 2 min
to unload a block. All 20 boats are initially located at the capital site by the river. You will be paid
in pharaoh coins for the job.
Job Rewards and expectations: You have one week to complete this task from the time you
